#3.3. - CSS Positioning Notes#

* **Fixed positioning** - Position at a specified place relative to the screen's viewport. Don't move it when scrolled. Printing means it will be in the same fixed position at the top of every page.
* **Relative positioning** - Adjusts the element's position *relative to itself*, without changing layout, thus leaving a gap for the element where it would have been had it not been positioned.
* **Z-index attribute** - Allows you to adjust the order of the layering of objects when rendering content.
* Has an integer value (positive or negative)
* A layer with a greater Z-index number is rendered above layers with smaller numbers
* Only has an effect if an element is *positioned*
* If a group of elements have no z-index property, they will position in the order of the HTML hierarchy!
* Standard blocks without positioning are always rendered *before* positioned elements (lower layer), regardless of HTML hierarchy
* Example of positioned elements is <position: relative>
