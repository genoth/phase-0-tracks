Release 4: Reflect

What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
-HTML5 semantic tags help keep the structure of web pages consistent and standardized, particularly when working with teams. It also helps for accessibility issues: screen readers work better when the semantic tags are used in a meaningful way.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
-The browser uses the top to bottom order to display HTML elements, but I think CSS styling can sometimes change that.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
-I learned that you can make snippets for more tab triggers, beyond the helpful ones that already exist in Sublime. As I learn about coding and what works best for me in Sublime, I'll create more snippets so I can be more efficient.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
-I think the most challenging concept for me was differentiating between some of the semantic elements, which seemed to be used interchangeably in some situations. I think I could improve my understanding of this by looking at resources on semantic structure, and by looking at examples of how different web sites use them.-->
